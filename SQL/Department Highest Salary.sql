Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, Max has the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

+------------+----------+--------+

| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |

select t2.Name as Department, t1.Name as Employee, t3.Salary as Salary
from Employee t1, Department t2, (select Max(Salary) as Salary, DepartmentId  from Employee group by DepartmentId) t3
where t3.Salary = t1.Salary and t3.DepartmentId=t2.Id and t2.Id = t1.DepartmentId
